# Gourmets' nightmare

A lot of gourmets struggle to find the perfect match of wine and cheese. 
A number of considerations are relevant, where each of them creates 
the unique combination, so finding the perfect match is a long-time assignment.  
Your assignment is not supposed to be long-time but it will use original but
scary matching criteria.

You will match by similarity of a letter frequency in a name of wine and cheese.

                 sum of occurence of chars shared by both words
    similarity = ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
                 1 + square of length difference of both words

Examples:  
//ToDo

Upper and lower case variants are ignored in the mathing process.  
Space " ", dash "-", and aposthrope "'" are considered as valid chars.

3 lists of wine are provided (red, white, sparkling).  
You will match them with 43 cheeses mentioned in the in the "Cheese Shop" sketch  
(from Monty Python's Flying Circus  
http://montypython.wikia.com/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch )

### Tasks
Complete the method *best_match_per_wine* which returns the best scored wine-cheese pair.
Matching can be for a certain wine type (i.e. red, white, sparkling) or for all types.

Complete the method *match_wine_5cheeses* which returns  for each wine 5 best matching cheeses.  
All types of wines (i.e. red, white, sparkling) are included.
